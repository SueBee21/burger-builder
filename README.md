# Burger-Builder

  ## Description 
  
This is a restaurant app that allows users to iput the names of burgers that they would like to eat. When a user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger name next to a button to "Eat-da-Burger".  Once the button is clicked, the burger name will appear in the "devoured" list on the right-hand side of the page. This app uses SQL databse technology to store every burger name, and whether or not it has been devoured.
